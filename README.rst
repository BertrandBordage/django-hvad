About this project
******************

This project is yet another attempt at making model translations suck less in
Django.

Planned Features
----------------

* Painless API for translated content in models
* Painless admin/form integration
* Predictable (in contrast to my previous attempt, django-multilingual-ng)
* High level (no custom SQL Compiler or other scary things)
* Few and simple queries

Again, DO NOT USE THIS! I'm serious, DON'T! I will *NOT* support this in any way
yet.

You are however very welcome to contribute to the project. (I'm especially
looking for a good name!)
