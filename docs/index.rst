About this project

django-nani provides a high level API to maintain multilingual content in your
database using the Django ORM.

Please note that this documentation assumes that you are very familiar with 
Django and Python, if you are not, please familiarize yourself with those first.

While django-nani tries to be as simple to use as possible, it's still
recommended that you only use it if you consider yourself to be very strong in
Python and Django.
